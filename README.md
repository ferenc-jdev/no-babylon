No-Babylon
==========

A job search engine leveraging public REST API(s) with custom filtering to provide jobs that are really 
relevant to the user's need.

Most job search engines provides support for keyword based search, but few of them has support to exclude jobs that
are irrelevant to the users. Searching for a job by keyword often include jobs that are not suitable for the user 
for various reasons (location, language skills, specific expertise or just an unwanted keyword).
The goal of No-Babylon is to be a search engine that can better suit people looking for a job.
